## tfidf : [Using TF-IDF to Determin Word Relevance in Document Queries](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.121.1424&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

- high TF-IDF numbers imply a strong relationship with the document they appear in
- tf-idf가 높은 단어가 있는 문서는 읽는이에게 관심이 높은 문서일 가능성이 있다.
- naive can result that it approach only to make high sum of f(w,d) - 한 문서에 존재하는 단어 수
- tf-idf: considering both f(w,d) and f(w,D) results high quality.
- Clearly, IF-IDF is much more powerful that its naive counterpart
- Have limitation : ex) synonyms and (dru <-> drugs) - For large document collections, this could present an escalating problem

## [Voice Recognition using Neural Networks](https://drive.google.com/drive/search?q=viewcontent)

- process : Mic -> ADC -> Parameter extraction -> Pattern matching(template memory) -> output device
- voice recognition system : Mic -> PC sound card -> Digital Signal Processing -> Neural Network -> output
- technique to extract unique features for voice Recognition is "PSD"
- Power Spectral Density(PSD) is computed by taking the magnitude-squared result of the Fourier transform
- The PSD of a voice sample contains unique features attributed to an individual and these are used in our studies
- PSD values are presented in a vector form to the pattern matching
- the experiment will only use PSD technique
- <Pattern Matching Using Neural Networks>
- Training Sample Input are PSD from voice of same phrase from many other people and output is the specific person who make this voice.
- ANN(Artifical Neural Networks) is used  for pattern matching
- 7 voice samples from four different people speaks same phrase
- 100% success rate with trained sample but 66% success rate with untrained sample
- <Self Organizing Maps(SOMs) has a better recognition ability compared to the backpropagation neural network>
- 7 voice samples from four different people same phrase
- 78% success rate with untrained sample
- conclusion : The use of artifical neural networks in voice recognition with PSD and SOM has proved that a fair amount of success.

### SOM(자기조직화지도)

차원축소와 군집화를 동시에 수행하는 기법

SOM이란 사람이 눈으로 볼 수 있는 저차원(2차원 또는 3차원) 격자에 고차원 데이터의 각 개체들이 대응하도록 인공신경망과 유사한 방식으로 순집을 도출해 내는 기법.
